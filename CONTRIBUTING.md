Guidelines for developers
=========================

1.  Changes should be made in a branch and submitted via Pull Request to the
    master branch.
2.  Pull Requests should be reviewed and Travis and Appveyor builds must
    succeed before merging.
3.  Keep the `CHANGELOG.md` up to date.


Continuous Integration Builds
